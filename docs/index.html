    # Charming

    > _Think of Charming as Lodash for graphics, or D3 for computational art._

    **Charming**, short for _Charming Computing_, is a [free](https://github.com/charming-art/charming/blob/main/LICENSE), [open-source](https://github.com/charming-art/charming) data-driven language for creative coding and ASCII art with high performance. It has a declarative, concise, yet expressive API inspired by [G2.js](https://github.com/antvis/G2), [D3.js](https://github.com/d3) and [P5.js](https://p5js.org/).

    ## Features

    Charming is built on the observation that both visualization and generative art are, to some extent, data-driven.

    Therefore, it provides a novel [flow-based](cm-flow) API for processing data, appending and transforming shapes. Charming also supports batch rendering of 2D primitives using a [WebGL renderer](examples/waltz-of-circles-webgl), and defining some [GLSL functions](examples/waltz-of-circles-glsl) to offload expensive computations to the GPU. Additionally, a [terminal renderer](examples/fire) for ASCII art, embedded in JavaScript, utilizes a software rasterizer written in Rust and compiled to WASM, aiming to achieve high performance. Charming also puts strong emphasis on extensible, composable, beginner-friendly and lightweight (29kb minified [core bundle](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@charming-art/charming/dist/cm.core.umd.min.js)).

    My hope with Charming is that you spend less time wrangling the machinery of programming and more time "using computing to tell stories". Or put more simply: **With Charming, you'll express more, and more easily.**
